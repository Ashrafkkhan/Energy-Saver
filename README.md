 Energy Management System Dashboard

An intelligent web-based platform that tracks, predicts, and visualizes energy consumption trends using real-time data analytics and AI-driven recommendations.
This project promotes sustainable energy habits by combining data visualization, machine learning predictions, and interactive education tools.

Features

 Dynamic Dashboard: Real-time charts for energy usage, cost, and efficiency.

 AI Prediction: Uses trained ML models (Python backend) to forecast future energy consumption.

 Smart Insights: Provides optimization tips and anomaly detection.

 Historical Data Tracking: Stores and visualizes past energy trends.

 Automated Alerts (Optional): Notify users of unusual consumption or threshold breaches.

 Dual Backend Support:

Python (FastAPI) for ML model handling and analytics APIs.

Java (Spring Boot) for anomaly detection
